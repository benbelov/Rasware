RasPy reads the serial output of the launchpad and allows for scripting and data visualization for the client computer.

Packages used:
- pySerial, for reading the serial output
- livewires, because it's way simpler to use than pygame for making basic graphics

Installation:
- install Python with the method of your choice (python 2.7 comes bundled on most linux systems)
: pip install setuptools
: sudo apt-get install python-tk
: pip install livewires
: pip install pyserial
