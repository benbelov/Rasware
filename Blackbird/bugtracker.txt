Problems and How to fix them
Document issues that might recur here


Functions such as malloc, sprintf, printf cause make errors:
     - malloc, sprintf, and printf use heap memory, which isn't available on the launchpad
     - declare variables in main, and pass &variables to functions instead.

Distance sensors are a bit weird, showing very high distances:
     - check that the batteries are going through the voltage regulator
     - inspecific, check that V_in is connected to V_in, not V_out
	 
Uart not working:
     - power cycle board, then reset
     - try a hard reset (hold down reset, power cycle release reset)
