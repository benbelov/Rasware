Problems and How to fix them
Document issues that might recur here


LED Debug Codes:
    - speed of flash indicates cycle time
    - mod 0: (always green) will always be on as a heartbeat
    - mod 1: lower number will take precedence to higher number, except 0
      - 10 = no errors; off
      - 1 = distance sensor disconnected; red
      - 2 = distance sensor timeout; purple
      - 3 = distance sensor too close; blue
      - X = unknown error code; white
    - mod 2:
      - 0 = output in UART mode; yellow
      - 1 = output in PySerial mode; ????  // not yet implemented

Functions such as malloc, sprintf, printf cause make errors:
     - malloc, sprintf, and printf use heap memory, which isn't available on the launchpad
     - declare variables in main, and pass &variables to functions instead.

Distance sensors are a bit weird, showing very high distances:
     - check that the batteries are going through the voltage regulator
     - inspecific, check that V_in is connected to V_in, not V_out
 	 
Uart not working:
     - power cycle board, then reset
     - try a hard reset (hold down reset, power cycle release reset)
